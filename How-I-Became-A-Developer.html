			<p>At the beginning i used to go to the public library near my home to surf the foreign English books that talk about Geology and Space. Even though  I don’t understand what they wrote inside because its in English and my mother tongue is Arabic but I enjoyed trying to read and surf and see the photos inside specially those of volcanoes.</p>
			
			<p>In 2000  my father bought a new desktop computer and I was interested in it from the first sight and that was the beginning of my interest in computers.  Although my beginning to learn programing language (Pascal) started on a class in high school but I had failed on it and couldn’t understand it.</p>
			
			<p>After graduation I kept chasing my dream and entered college and got accepted in computer science department in university of Basra. My teachers  were so great and they tought me various programing languages  such as C++, Java, Visual Basic,  PHP, HTML+CSS. Along with various primary computer courses. I found myself better than other student only in  programing languages and that made me more confident to do  a challengeable graduation project. I liked to make a small robot but unfortunately I couldn’t have enough resources and knowledge which force me to reduce my idea and do something simpler so I make a program using VC++.NET to control a device designed by my friend to control the electricity in houses and because of my graduation project I had participated in the fourth sovereignty festival for scientific innovation.</p>
            
            <p>After graduation I started seeking job with passion to be a professional programmer and dreamed to work in a big company abroad. Unfortunately, I couldn’t do so and without someone to guide me I had lost my way for 2 year then I decided to change my current situation and follow my dream so I decided to take my next step which was getting master degree in computer sciences.  After several tries in various countries such as Germany, Australia and Britain. Finally I got accepted in China in HUST University. The two years I spend there were so great and they made me confident again. I was able to meet so great people from several countries. And my professor their accepted and supported my thesis project. Again my idea was big and I wanted to make a kind of operating system that works  as hypervisor Type 1. My professor said its too big and I don’t have time to do it so I need to make something much more simpler so I can graduate on time so I make ( Efficient VM Memory Balancing Algorithm Design and Implementation ) and I present it in the 3rd  ICNISC conference  in shanghai –China.</p>
            
            <p>While I was in china I had visited Huawei And ZTE head quarter in Shenzhen and later tried to get a job in one of these companies but I couldn’t and my visa ended so I went back home.</p>
            
            <p>When I went back I found myself well educated but I lacked practical training so I started to search and found a good program in the United states but unfortunately the USA embassy refused my application visa so I had to wait for six months before applying again. So as long as I'm  waiting I decided to use my time well and look for another opportunity to get a practical training. and then I saw the one million Arab coders initiative and I registered and joined cohort 1. After finishing it I continued my training and joined Udacity Full Stack web developer and I will finish it soon and wait to see what and where my next step will be.</p>
