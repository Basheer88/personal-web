			<p>With the rapid growth of Artificial intelligence most companies are competing to produce  the best AI solutions. Even computer manufacturing produce CPU with AI compatibility. People started  using it specially in factories. Consequently,  an old question from several years ago  started to rise again; could AI take our jobs and control our life?  Actually now a days we depend on technology more than before and this will increase in the future . For example recently in china they start using robots to teach kids in  kindergarten. In addition to that, IBM made a computer with self-in learning and they entered English dictionary and urban dictionary too. After a while the computer started to use curse words almost  just like normal people. As a result, they shutdown it and put a language filter to fix it. These experiences  prove  the ability of robots to learn,  think, and talk like human.</p>
			
			<p>According to me; I believe that AI will take over everything in the  future. Since computer chips will become cheap; they will be founded everywhere even in contact lances. University students will no longer need to memorize lectures, rather they will only blink to retrieve any information.  When people face a medical issue they can counsel a robot doctor at the Internet in any language. The same for our cars, they'll be smart enough to converse with their drivers. Moreover, robots are already used in factories, and the role of AI can add the factor of creativity to these robots to be more active in the workplace.  All these and more will definitely affect the economical system.</p>
			
			<p>The fact that robots lack emotions might be the next obstacle that needs to be avoided,  but I am sure that in the future scientist will find a way to add the factor of emotions to robots. The rapid development in manufacturing robots, and the recent foundings that come along with the adding AI; all these elements made it possible to take our expectations high. Throughout the human history we found that everything people thought to be impossible turned out to be possible so  the same thing  will happen later for what we are thinking now to be impossible for robots regarding their intelligence.</p>
